["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction Nutrient pollution is a global environmental problem. In lakes, too many nutrients can have an impact on water quality. Phosphorus and nitrogen are an essential part of aquatic ecosystems. However, an excess of these nutrients could lead to what is known as algae bloom, a large algae growth. When the amount of algae increases, the oxygen in the water decreases, causing the fish to die. The algal bloom also produces toxins that can affect human health. Utah Lake is no exception to this problem. Nevertheless, some studies have shown that the algal bloom in this lake is different than expected in the presence of phosphorus and nitrogen. The algal bloom in Utah Lake depends not only on the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen, but also on other parameters. The data of many parameters will be analyzed to find if there is a relation between them and the algal bloom. "]
